The main script lets users book bus tickets by entering their name, choosing a destination, and selecting how many seats they want. The system then works out the total price and shows a message.

# What I Tested
I made tests for three main things:

Checking if the booking is valid (tests if name, destination and seats are filled in correctly)
Making sure the price calculation works right (each seat costs $10)
Checking if the right messages show up (success or error messages)

# How to Run the Tests

First, make sure you have Node.js installed
cd Bus-system
Run npm install to get all the required packages
Run npm test to start the tests
